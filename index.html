      <h2>üéµ Jodi tare nai chini go</h2>
      <p>
        This song reminds me of the magical moment when you truly saw me for who I am.<br>
        It felt like you had recognized me even before I recognized myself.<br>
        I wanted you to choose me in my subconscious mind and wanted to give time to ensure both you and myself.<br>
        The way you understood my silence and my heart made me feel chosen.<br>
        You didn‚Äôt just enter my life ‚Äî you completed it by making me your soulmate.<br>
        Every time I hear this song, I relive that first moment of being deeply, beautifully identified.<br>
        It is the beginning of our love story, where my journey found its true direction.
